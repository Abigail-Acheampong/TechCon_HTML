   <h2>History of TechCon</h2>
   <p>TechCon began in 1996 in New Orleans, Louisiana, as a modest gathering of tech enthusiasts and industry professionals.
   Over the years, it has grown into a premier global conference, hosted in various cities across the United States and
   beyond. The conference has evolved to address the rapid advancements in technology, from the early days of the internet
   to the current era of artificial intelligence and semiconductor innovation. Each year, TechCon attracts hundreds of
   attendees from diverse sectors, including utilities, semiconductors, and software development, fostering collaboration
   and innovation. Notable milestones include the introduction of CareerConnections in 2010, a recruiting event connecting
   students with industry leaders, and the expansion to include international delegates from over 11 countries by 2024.</p>
